## Chapter 7: Manipulating Strings

Understanding strings and how they can be manipulated in YOLOL might become one of the most important skills for anyone interested in building more complex structures with it.
Reversing and reducing strings as well as getting single characters from them are the topics of this chapter!

### Reducing Strings
Just like you can reduce a number with the `--` operator, you can also reduce a string's length.
Say we have a field titled `input` which holds the value `"Hello World!"`.
If we then reduce our input with `--` it will then hold `"Hello World"` - the exclamation mark has been removed!

Alternatively to get rid of a specific character or part of your string you can also simply use `-=` while providing one or more characters you would like to have removed. Time for an example!

>**Step #1:**<br>
>Try running the following snippet to see the difference between -- and -= in action!

>###### SNIPPET
>input="Hello World!"
>input--
>input-="Hello "

### Counting by reducing
To get the length of a String we simply need to count the amount of times we need to reduce it by one character. The easiest way of realizing this would be to loop over the given string and applying the `--` operator while increasing a new field which will act as our counter. So, let's implement exactly that!

>###### SNIPPET
>input="Hello" counter=0
>if input!="" then input-- counter++ goto 2 else goto 3 end
>goto 3

The above code checks whether the given string is empty or not - if it isn't it reduces the string by one character and increases our counter.

And boom! We have our first string-counter, for whatever we could need it for!
Though: There are quicker variants of achieving this result by abusing the power of errors! More on that in the next chapter!


### Reversing and getting characters of a string

// TODO explain what is actually happening here
```
input = "AAAAA Helo" i=input
if input != "" then a = i---i goto 2 end
```
