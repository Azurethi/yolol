## Chapter 3: Data fields

Last chapter we left off on finding our way into the basics. However, we did not code a single line yet.<br>

### Accessing data fields
Let's say we want to change the current state from an imaginary door from closed to open. For that, we'd have to change the data field we'll call `openState` from `0` to `1`. So let's try the following:

> ###### SNIPPET
> openState=1

Upon running the code and pausing it right after a new local variable is added. However our original goal to change the `openState` data field of our device was not achieved, as seen in the picture:

##### Why..?
What happens here is that we didn't address a data field at all. Instead we created a local variable. To address a data field we need to add a colon (`:`) in front of the name of the field, like this: <br>
`:openState`<br>
Let's change this in our code! In order to be able to change the code we'll have to stop it from being executed.

>**Step #3:**<br>
>Click the `Stop`-button in the top left and change `openState` to `:openState` in your code.

Upon rerunning the code it should now change the `openState` of our door-device to the value you assigned it to.<br>
**We opened our door!!**

#### Difference between local variables and device specific data fields
Just like data fields, local variables are able to hold any type of value allowed in YOLOL (Strings or numbers). However, they do not directly affect the device like data fields. Variables are rather for temporarily saving data to use in calculations or the like. We might not need them for simple code like the one we just wrote but we'll definitely need them in later chapters.
