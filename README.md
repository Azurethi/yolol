This tutorial covers everything from the basics to optimization in YOLOL!<br>
I will try to explain the concepts behind YOLOL to the best of my extent, however if any questions should arise while reading through the tutorial feel free to 
drop by in the [CYLON Discord Server](https://discord.gg/jkXcT74) or simply ask in [#yolol-code](https://discord.gg/jV83sSVanb) of the official Starbase Discord.

A huge shout-out deserves [Azurethi(#0789)](https://github.com/azurethi) for providing Yazur, the open-source clientside YOLOL interpreter which he wrote. His work made V2 of this tutorial even possible, so I can't be thankful enough for his amazing contribution!
